This project is a complete deep-learning application that trains and deploys a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize real-world digits from the SVHN dataset.  The final product is an interactive web app built with Streamlit where you can upload a photo of a single digit and get a live, real-time prediction from the trained model.
